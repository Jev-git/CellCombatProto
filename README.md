# Write up on this prototype
## Things I have learnt
* [Parallax scrolling without camera](./Scenes/Room/RoomBossTest.gd)
* [Boss with randomized attack patterns](./Scenes/Enemies/Bosses/Warrior/Warrior.gd)
* [2D shockwave shader](./Shaders/shockwave.shader) ([source tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCHdglr35pk))
## Some design decisions
* Grid based combat helps the player move around more quickly and accurately, no need for dashing
* Melee combat helps inscrease the speed and intensity of the fight
